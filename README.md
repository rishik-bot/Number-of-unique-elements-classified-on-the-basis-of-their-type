# Number-of-unique-elements-classified-on-the-basis-of-their-type
PS: Given a list, with Pokemon names (element) along with their type (Eg. ['Bulbasaur,Grass','Ivysaur,Grass','Venusaur,Grass','Charmander,Fire'...]).
We need to display the pokemon type and the number of pokemons falling under that type
# expected output:
['Grass,91','Fire,18','Bug,87','...]
